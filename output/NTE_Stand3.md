# // PART 1: THE RESURRECTION GOSPEL //

## OUR SPEAKING ABOUT JESUS

In pairs, one of you take the part of a non-Christian who asks, "So what do Christians believe?" The other partner can take the role of a Christian and try to provide them with a short two minute answer. When you've finished swap roles.

Note down the main ideas or issues you included in your gospel explanation.

## APOSTOLIC SPEAKING ABOUT JESUS

In small groups, skim read two of the following passages and note:
*   What part does Jesus' death (and its' significance) play in the apostles' gospel proclamation
*   What part does the Jesus' resurrection (and its' significance) play in the apostolic gospel proclamation

| | Significance of Jesus' death | Significance of Jesus' resurrection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Acts 2:14–41 | | |
| Acts 4:8–12 | | |
| Acts 10:27–43 | | |
| Acts 13:13–41 | | |
| Acts 17:16–34 | | |
| Romans 1:3–4 | | |
| Romans 10:9–13 | | |
| 1 Corinthians 15:1–4 | | |
| 2 Timothy 1:8–12 | | |
| 2 Timothy 2:8 | | |

What differences did you notice between our ways and the apostles' ways of speaking about Jesus?

Why might there be differences?

What questions does this raise about the resurrection and how it fits into the gospel?

# THE LOGIC OF THE GOSPEL

We are used to the logic of **Jesus' death for us**. Let's try and create a diagram of it.

# // PART 2: SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY //

Congratulations! You’re doing Systematic Theology! But let’s step back and think about Systematic Theology itself.

## WHAT IS SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY?

Systematic Theology is organising our knowledge of God into topics, so we can understand each topic better.
What is the relationship between systematic theology and biblical theology?

Why bother with Biblical Theology? Why not just jump straight to Systematic Theology?

## DOING SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY

### 1. Data Collection (Gathering the right bricks)
As you read through the Bible you will find passages that speak about the topic. These passages give us the basic ideas we need to understand our topic. So we go looking for them and then gather them all up into our truck.

> *Text appearing in diagram boxes:*
> *   **1 Corinthians 15:20** Jesus rose as the firstfruits
> *   **Acts 2:32–36** Jesus rose as the king
> *   **Romans 1:4** Jesus was raised by the Spirit
> *   **Galatians 1:1** Jesus was raised by the Father
> *   **John 20:1–30** Jesus rose from the dead

### 2. Synthesis (Building the house)
The Bible doesn’t just give us the bricks and say, “Go build a house.” It also gives us the plans for how to build the right house with the bricks we’ve been given. In other words, the Bible tells us how to put the data from our verses together so that we get an accurate understanding of the topic. Some verses are foundational, others are related but less important.

### 3. Integration (Location, location, location!)
When we build our house, we also need to think about where it should be located in the suburb. Where should our “Resurrection” house stand in relation to the “Cross” house, the “God” house, and the “Humanity” house? Are they connected? In what ways? In what order should we see them as we travel down the street? And if the foundations of one house are wobbly, in what ways will that affect the other houses?

### 4. Application (Moving in)
Once we’ve built our house with the right bricks, according to the building plans, in just the right spot for it in the suburb, we don’t want to just pat ourselves on the back and wander off—it’s time to move in and enjoy! As we settle in to the house and suburb God has given us, we want to live in light of the truths we’ve discovered. As the Holy Spirit works in us to do that, we become more and more mature. More and more like Jesus.

# WHY SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY?

1.  You’re doing it anyway



2.  It’s essential in reading and teaching the Bible



3.  Most of the issues and questions we face as Christians come in a Systematic Theology form



4.  It’s essential in opposing false teaching

# PART 3: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

## 3.1 SIFTING THROUGH THE DATA

Helpful steps:
1.  **Search** for the word
2.  It may be helpful to **search for other forms** of the word
3.  **Brainstorm passages** that you know speaks about the topic
4.  **Search related ideas** and the different forms of these words

Now you’ll have a lot of data to sort through!!

Over the next few pages is a table which are the results from a computer search on the New Testament on resur* or raise* or rise* or lift*.

Now some analysis work has already been done for you in that some are irrelevant to the topic of resurrection (e.g. eyes are raised).

Even then, there is a huge amount of data. Your job now is to sift through the data and
1. Look out for:
    *   New ideas (to you),
    *   Things that don’t make sense/don’t fit with what you already think;
    *   Passages on ‘resurrection’ (rather than passages that refer to resurrection in passing); and,
    *   Old Testament references about resurrection

2. See whether you can label the passage with a particular topic and gather passages which speak of similar topics together (begin the process of analysis).

Another way to gather the Biblical material about any Systematic Theology topic is to think 'Biblical Theology'. You will hopefully remember this diagram of the theological storyline of the Bible from Strand 2.

### OLD TESTAMENT | NEW TESTAMENT

*(Diagram description: A 'V' shaped timeline representing the history of the Kingdom)*

*   **The PATTERN of the Kingdom**
    *   Creation
*   **The PERISHED Kingdom**
    *   Fall
*   **The PROMISED Kingdom**
    *   Abraham
*   **The PARTIAL Kingdom (a)**
    *   Israel
*   **The PARTIAL Kingdom (b)**
    *   David
    *   *(Arrow pointing down)* **The PERISHING Kingdom**
*   *(Arrow pointing up)* **The FULFILLED Kingdom**
    *   Jesus' 1st coming
*   **The PRESENT Kingdom**
    *   Now / Not Yet
*   **The PERFECTED Kingdom**
    *   New Creation

It gives us some significant staging posts in God's plans and purposes that culminate in Jesus. So it gives us some particular places in our Bibles to collect and synthesise data. In this case, with the topic of resurrection, the data we are looking for is data connected to the idea of resurrection, in particular 'life' and 'death'. Before we dig into a few passages, see what you can collect from what you know already.

| SIGNIFICANT STAGING POSTS | WHAT WE LEARN ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH (AND RESURRECTION) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creation –**<br>The Pattern of the Kingdom | |
| **Fall –**<br>The Perished Kingdom | |
| **Israel –**<br>The Partial kingdom<br>(esp. the promises to Abraham) | |
| **New Covenant –**<br>The Prophesied Kingdom<br>(esp the promises to David) | |

| **Jesus 2 –**<br>The Perfected Kingdom | |

# // PART 4: SYNTHESIS //

At this point there would normally still be a lot of work for you to do in sorting out which passages to focus on and how to fit them together. But in order to speed up the process, we're going to focus on some specific issues that are important for understanding resurrection.

When it comes to developing our systematic theology on resurrection we could start with any of the big ideas we've identified. But because it's probably most familiar to us — and more importantly because the apostles' proclamation of the gospel seems to focus there — we're going to start by exploring some aspects of Jesus' resurrection.

## 4.1 THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS

What do you know about Jesus' resurrection (from the passages you may have looked at in the data collection or from general knowledge)?

*   What was the nature of his resurrection body?

*   Was it a permanent resurrection?

*   Was the resurrected Jesus the same as the "pre-crucified" Jesus

*   Is the resurrected Jesus human or divine and does it matter?

*   Is the resurrected Jesus doing anything now? If so, what?

If you saw an item on the news reporting that a dead person had come back to life (with very good eye-witness evidence), what would you make of it?

*   Would you conclude the person was God?

*   Would you conclude that the person was going to be the judge of the world?

*   Would you conclude that you would be raised to life after death?

So why do you think the resurrection of Jesus has any special significance

## 4.2 JESUS' RESURRECTION AND US

**Key Text 1 Corinthians 15**
**Read vv 1–11**
What is Paul doing?

**Read vv 12–19**
What are some of the Corinthians saying about resurrection?

**Read vv 20–58.**
From these verses, what questions/objections might they have had about resurrection?

Recapping the whole chapter, what can you conclude about how important resurrection is in Paul's gospel?

**Exploring the logic**
In pairs, gather information from 1 Corinthians 15:14–26 to fill in the first two columns.

| If Christ **hasn't** been raised from then dead, then... | If Christ **has** been raised from the dead, then... | Why? What is Paul's logic? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Our preaching is useless | Our preaching is useful | |

Using verses 20–28, draw a timeline of world history.

**(Timeline Diagram)**
|----------**Creation**----------**(Cross)** **(Up Arrow)**----------**New Creation**----------|
                                    Jesus'
                                 resurrection

When is Christ reigning?

When does he destroy all dominion/rule, authority and power?

What do we learn about the nature and history of "death"?

> **EXCURSUS: DEATH**
>
> What did Adam do that has caused us all to die? (v22; cf. Genesis 3:17–19)
>
> <br>
>
> What sort of death did Adam die? (compare Genesis 2:15–17 with Genesis 3:17–19 and 5:3–5)
>
> <br>
>
> In what sense is death an enemy?
>
> <br>
>
> How do you see this reflected in human experience
>
> <br>
>
> What is needed for death to be defeated?

**Read 1 Corinthians 15:22, 42–49 again.**
In what ways is Christ like Adam?

In what ways is Christ not like Adam?

What is the connection between Jesus’ resurrection and our resurrection?

**Go back to 1 Corinthians 15:50–58**
What will happen to us?

What is the relationship between death, sin, and the law?

How has Jesus defeated death?

What will “death being swallowed up in victory” look like?

**Read Romans 8:19–20**
Does Jesus’ resurrection only have implications for humans?

How does who we will be give you hope in the face of groaning and death?

**// Add to the diagram //**
Add these topics to the diagram and in the light of what we’ve just looked at, add in connections:

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| humans | Jesus' rule |
| sin | resurrection of the dead (i.e. general resurrection) |
| death | new creation |

## 4.3 JESUS’ RESURRECTION: RULING THE WORLD

Remember Luke 16:31, “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.” Understanding the Old Testament and its expectations is necessary for understanding resurrection (see also 1 Peter 1:10–12).

There are lots of Old Testament passages we could look at that connect to Jesus’ resurrection: eg. Genesis 3:15, 5:24, Psalm 16, 110, Daniel 7, Genesis 22, 37–47, Jonah 1:17–2:10 (referred to in Matthew 12:39–40), 2 Kings 18:5; 20:5, 8, Hosea 6:1–2, and lots, lots more. You might like to look them up and think through how they relate to resurrection.

For the moment we’re going to focus on Psalm 8, partly because it’s quoted in 1 Corinthians 15:27, and partly because it’s so significant for our understanding of resurrection

**Jesus’ resurrection and the place of humanity**
Read **Psalm 8**. In the Psalm:
Under whose feet has God put everything?

What passage(s) in the Bible might be the background to this understanding?

What position has God given humans in his creation?

Why has God done that?

Is Psalm 8 a realistic portrayal of human life?

Has God withdrawn his intention for humanity?

Hebrews 2:6–8 also quotes Psalm 8. **Read Hebrews 2:5–15.**
What does this passage say about how realistic Psalm 8 is in its portrayal of human life?

Has God withdrawn his intention for humanity?

How is God fulfilling his intention for humanity

How good a ruler is Jesus?

What result will Jesus’ rule have for us?

Re-read 1 Corinthians 15:23–27. What connection(s) does Paul see between Psalm 8 and resurrection?

Jesus and his people with him will rule over all creation. This is who humanity was meant to be.
How does this affect how you live now? (e.g. your purpose, striving/success, priorities)?

### The resurrection of the Messiah
In 1 Corinthians 15 and many of the passages we have looked at, Jesus is identified as “Christ” or “Messiah”. Christ is not Jesus’ surname but his title. He is the Christ, the anointed one — in other words, the king.

1 Samuel 10:1 and 16:1, 13 record Saul and David being anointed as the sign that they were to be the first two kings of Israel.

1. Read **2 Samuel 7:1–17** and note down the promises God made to David.

2. What do the following passages suggest about the place of David’s son in Israel’s future?

Psalm 2

Psalm 18:50



Psalm 89:19–37

Isaiah 9:1–7



Ezekiel 37:25–28

Zechariah 12:7–13:1

3. Write down in your own words how the Apostles used Jesus' resurrection to show that he is the Christ.



4. In 2 Timothy 2:8 Paul summarises his gospel as Jesus “descended from David, raised from the dead.”
Why are these two things at the heart of Paul’s gospel?



5. Romans 1:3–4 says that Jesus “was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead.”
How does Jesus’ resurrection appoint him Son of God?

# 4.4 RESURRECTION AND LIFE NOW

**Read Ephesians 1:18–23**

In 1:18–19 Paul prays that “the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know...”
1. the hope to which he has called you
2. the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people
3. his incomparably great power for us who believe

In verses 19b–23 Paul expands on the third point. What has God’s incomparably great power/mighty strength done?

---

### Read Ephesians 2:1–10

**How does this passage illuminate God’s “incomparably great power for us who believe”?**


**Who benefits from this? How?**


**What has God in his power done for us?**


**How? Why? When?**


**What connections can you see between what God did for Jesus and what he’s done for us?**


**What do you think the results would be of God enlightening the eyes of our hearts to know his “incomparably great power for us who believe”?**

---

**How can we be sure God will “give life to our mortal bodies” (Rom 8:9–11)?**


**So how have we been “made alive/raised with Christ” (Eph 2:5–6)?**


**Read Colossians 3:1–10**
**What has happened to us?**


**What will happen to us?**


**What should we do *now*? Why?**


**If we are truly raised and seated with Christ, how would our lives look different? What do you need to change to grow in living out who you really are?**

# // PART 5: PULLING IT TOGETHER //

1. Acts 17:31 teaches that “God has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed, and he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.”

Can you explain how Jesus’ resurrection is proof of this?



2. 1 Peter 1:3–4 teaches that God “has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead”

Describe as extensively as you can the connections between Jesus’ resurrection and:

a) our new birth


b) our living hope


c) our inheritance (v4)



#### // Add to the diagram //

See if you can work out where these could fit

*   Final judgement

# // PART 6: INTEGRATION & APPLICATION //

The task of integration is exploring the connections between different theological topics. We've been doing that throughout this strand, but now we're going to look at one particular passage to see how it connects resurrection to various other topics, and one particular application to life now.

**Read 1 Corinthians 6:9–20**

What issue is Paul discussing with the Corinthians?




What are the Corinthians saying?




What can you work out about why they might have been saying that?




What does Paul say about our bodies?




What connections can you see to the topic of resurrection?




So how might our doctrine of resurrection shape our thinking about ethics?

# // PART 7: PROCLAIMING RESURRECTION //

## 7.1 SOME IDEAS

**Points of contact**

So far, what we have done in doing Systematic Theology is to understand a topic coherently. More than that, in understanding what God says about resurrection we’ve been given real hope and purpose. We know that Jesus is our risen saviour and judge, messiah and lord of the universe. We know that he has risen victorious over death, and that we are united to him by the Spirit through faith. Where he goes, we go. So we’re looking forward to his return and our resurrection to share with him in the new creation. And we know that what we do with our bodies really matters, because our bodies are not disposable shells, but an integral part of us.

It’s beautiful! But how do we use what we’ve learnt to connect with others who don’t know Jesus, and to invite them to share with us in all the benefits of his resurrected life

Some points of contact might be:
*   Death
*   Birth and new life
*   Ageing bodies, disease
*   Morality
*   Purpose

What others can you think of?



Once you’ve identified these points of contact, how can you use them to talk about Jesus, resurrection, and what it means for life?



How will you relate it to the story of resurrection?



How will you invite them to respond?



**Options**

There are all sorts of ways you could try and persuade others about the truths we’ve uncovered about resurrection, you could write song or a poem, prepare a Bible study, create a drama.

But to keep it simple we’re giving you a choice between writing a short talk (10mins max.) or creating an evangelistic tract focused on resurrection.

**Notes that are helpful for putting together a tract and writing a talk**

We don’t all go about doing things the same way; some of us are creative lateral thinkers while others are more systematic linear thinkers. So there is no “right” way to go about this. It is important that you work in a way that is loving and encouraging to others (especially if tiredness is creeping in).

Here are some suggestions to stimulate your thinking (don’t be restricted to them or their order)

### a. Lateral thinking
Brainstorm ideas surrounding questions like:
*   What is it about the resurrection that is true, exciting, relevant to non-Christians?
*   How do they think about such things at present? Can we connect?
*   How do we want them to respond when they hear this gospel? What might move in that direction?
*   What images, illustrations, analogies come to mind?
*   Is there a big idea that you could hang the whole message from?
*   Is there a Bible passage that captures the heart of what you want to say? How could you use it?

### b. Linear thinking
Work logically and systematically
Try to list the main points you want to make
*   Which of these need explanation, justification, background information? (Add these as extra points that need to be made.)
*   How do all the points relate to each other?
*   Is there an order (temporal or logical) in which to make the points?
*   Is there a story to be told in a particular order?
*   Where can we start? (so listeners can “get on board” even if they don’t agree.)
*   How can we finish

From all this raw material, try to set out the main skeleton of the ideas in order.

### c. Deciding
*   Which ideas are crucial?
*   What order of ideas makes the most sense?
*   Will we use any visuals in the presentation? If so, what?
*   If you’re creating a tract, will you use the Bible explicitly? If so, how many passages, and which ones?

### d. Refining
*   Leave out ideas that are unnecessary, confusing, distracting
*   Get the logic clear
*   Get the wording clear — accurate, concise, jargon-free
*   Crystallising the ending
*   For a tract:
    *   Get any visuals simple, clear, effective, integrated
    *   Fit the words and visuals together

### e. Trialling
*   Read through your talk or tract out loud, are there any bits that sound clunky?
*   Try padding out the bare form to see if there are better ways of saying it
*   Practice the whole thing on someone outside Strand 3 – see if it makes sense

### 7.2 PREPARING TO PROCLAIM

This is your chance to prepare a clear, persuasive gospel proclamation focused on resurrection.

### 7.3 THE PROCLAMATION

As you listen to each other, think about:
*   The clarity of what was said about the resurrection
*   The accuracy of what was said about the resurrection
*   The coherence of what was said
*   The language used
*   The visuals used

What was the best thing about the presentation of the talk/tract?

What is one change that could improve things?

### 7.4 CONCLUSION

*   General discussion
*   Review. Retell the story of the resurrection and show it on the diagram again.
*   Prayer
*   Photos/swap emails and Facebook contacts, etc!

# // APPENDIX 1: RECOMMENDED RESOURCES //

### INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY
*   T.C. Hammond, **In understanding Be Men** (IVP)
    An older book but a good read. The introduction serves as a good summary of the purpose of systematic theology.
*   B. Milne, **Know the Truth** (IVP)
    Good on the practical implications of what we believe.
*   P.F. Jensen, **At the Heart of the Universe** (Lancer)
    Probably the best. Especially good on the framework for systematic theology.
*   J.I. Packer, **Knowing God** (Hodder & Stoughton)
    An important book on the place of Scripture in doing systematic theology. Encouraging and nourishing!
*   A. McGrath, **A Cloud of Witnesses – Ten Great Christian Thinkers** (IVP)
    Introduces some key theological ideas by examining their main proponents in history. Nice short chapters. A good read even if you don't like history.
*   P.D. Jensen & T. Payne, **The Blueprint** (Matthias Media)
    Studies on the AFES doctrinal statement, including research and discussion questions.

### GENERAL REFERENCE WORKS
*   W.A. Elwell (ed), **Evangelical Dictionary of Theology** (Baker)
    Probably the best of the dictionaries.
*   D.F. Wright, S.B. Ferguson & J.I. Packer (eds), **New Dictionary of Theology** (IVP)
*   D.R.W. Wood, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, D.J. Wiseman & I. Howard Marshall (eds), **New Bible Dictionary** (IVP)
    Includes articles on many theological ideas
*   M. J. Erickson, **Christian Theology** (Baker)
    More a text book than a dictionary. For the serious student.

### THEOLOGY OF RESURRECTION
*   P. Beasley-Murray, **The Message of the resurrection** (BST)
    This book explores all the major NT passages about resurrection. It is simple to read, well structured and helps you think through the implications of the resurrection.
*   O'Donovan, **Resurrection and Moral Order** (Eerdmans)
    A super-dense but profound treatment of the significance of resurrection to life, especially ethics.
*   M. Harris, **Raised immortal; resurrection and immortality in the New Testament** (Eerdmans)
    Good on the reality and nature of Jesus' resurrection, less on the theological significance of Jesus' resurrection
*   P. Head (Ed), **Proclaiming the Resurrection** (Paternoster Press)
*   N.T. Wright, **The Resurrection of the Son of God** (Augsburg)
    An epic read (over 800 pages), but great for a serious student who is prepared to think hard.
*   R. Shiner, **Raised Forever** (Matthias)
    Introduction to how the resurrection changes everything

### APOLOGETICS ON JESUS' RESURRECTION
*   L. Strobel, **The Case for the Resurrection: A first-century investigative reporter probes history's pivotal event.**
*   J. McDowell, **The Resurrection Factor: Does the historical evidence support the resurrection of Jesus Christ?**
*   M. Licona, **The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach**
*   P. Lapide, **The Resurrection of Jesus: A Jewish Perspective**
    An interesting read. A Jewish man investigates and comes to the conclusion that the resurrection of Jesus happened but remains a Jew. Sort of the Luke 16 scenario.
