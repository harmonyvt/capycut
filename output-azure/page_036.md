*Notes that are helpful for putting together a tract and writing a talk*

We don't all go about doing things the same way; some of us are creative lateral thinkers while others are systematic, linear thinkers. So there is no "right" way to go about this task. It is important that we work in a way that is loving and encouraging to others (especially if tiredness is creeping in).

Here are some suggestions to stimulate your thinking (don't be restricted to them or their order):

### a. Lateral thinking

Brainstorm ideas surrounding questions like:
• What is it about the resurrection that is true, exciting, relevant to non-Christians?
• How do they think about such things at present? Can we connect?
• How do we want them to respond when they hear this gospel?
• What images, illustrations, analogies come to mind? What might move in that direction?
• Is there a big idea that you could hang the whole message from?
• Is there a Bible passage that captures the heart of what you want to say? How could you use it?

### b. Linear thinking

Work logically and systematically

Try to list the main points you want to make
• Which of these need explanation, justification, background information? (Add these as extra points that need to be made.)
• How do all the points relate to each other?
• Is there an order (temporal or logical) in which to make the points?
• Is there a story to be told in a particular order?
• Where can we start? (so listeners can "get on board" even if they don't agree.)
• How can we finish

From all this raw material, try to set out the main skeleton of the ideas in order.

### c. Deciding

• Which ideas are crucial?
• What order of ideas makes the most sense?
• Will we use any visuals in the presentation? If so, what?
• If you're creating a tract, will you use the Bible explicitly? If so, how many passages, and which ones?

### d. Refining

• Leave out ideas that are unnecessary, confusing, distracting
• Get the logic clear
• Get the wording clear — accurate, concise, jargon-free
• Crystallising the ending
• For a tract:
  — Get any visuals simple, clear, effective, integrated
  — Fit the words and visuals together

### e. Trialling

• Read through your talk or tract out loud, are there any bits that sound clunky?
• Try padding out the bare form to see if there are better ways of saying it
• Practice the whole thing on someone outside Strand 3 – see if it makes sense
