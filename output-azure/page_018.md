Another way to gather the Biblical material about any Systematic Theology topic is to think 'Biblical Theology'. You will hopefully remember this diagram of the theological storyline of the Bible from Strand 2.

## OLD TESTAMENT | NEW TESTAMENT

**The PATTERN of the Kingdom** - Creation

**The PERISHED Kingdom** - Fall

**The PROMISED Kingdom** - Abraham

**The PARTIAL Kingdom (a)** - Israel

**The PARTIAL Kingdom (b)** - David

**The PERISHing Kingdom**

**The FULFILLED Kingdom** - Jesus' 1st coming

**The PRESENT Kingdom** - Now / Not Yet

**The PERFECTED Kingdom** - New Creation

It gives us some significant staging posts in God's plans and purposes that culminate in Jesus. So it gives us some particular places in our Bibles to collect and synthesise data. In this case, with the topic of resurrection, the data we are looking for is data connected to the idea of resurrection, in particular 'life' and 'death'. Before we dig into a few passages, see what you can collect from what you know already.

| SIGNIFICANT STAGING POSTS | WHAT WE LEARN ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH (AND RESURRECTION) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Creation – The Pattern of the Kingdom | |
| Fall – The Perished Kingdom | |
| Israel – The Partial kingdom (esp. the promises to Abraham) | |
| New Covenant – The Prophesied Kingdom (esp the promises to David) | |
| Jesus 1 – The Fulfilled Kingdom | |
| Jesus 2 – The Perfected Kingdom | |
