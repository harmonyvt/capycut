*Re-read 1 Corinthians 15:23-27. What connection(s) does Paul see between Psalm 8 and resurrection?*


*Jesus and his people with him will rule over all creation. This is who humanity was meant to be. How does this affect how you live now? (e.g. your purpose, striving/success, priorities)?*


### The resurrection of the Messiah

In 1 Corinthians 15 and many of the passages we have looked at, Jesus is identified as "Christ" or "Messiah". Christ is not Jesus' surname but his title. He is the Christ, the anointed one — in other words, the king.

1 Samuel 10:1 and 16:1, 13 record Saul and David being anointed as the sign that they were to be the first two kings of Israel.

1. **Read 2 Samuel 7:1-17** and note down the promises God made to David.


2. *What do the following passages suggest about the place of David's son in Israel's future?*

**Psalm 2**

**Psalm 18:50**

**Psalm 89:19-37**

**Isaiah 9:1-7**

**Ezekiel 37:25-28**

**Zechariah 12:7-13:1**
