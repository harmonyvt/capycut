# // PART 2: SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY //

Congratulations! You're doing Systematic Theology! But let's step back and think about Systematic Theology itself.

## WHAT IS SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY?

Systematic Theology is organising our knowledge of God into topics, so we can understand each topic better. What is the relationship between systematic theology and biblical theology?

Why bother with Biblical Theology? Why not just jump straight to Systematic Theology?

## DOING SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY

### 1. Data Collection (Gathering the right bricks)

As you read through the Bible you will find passages that speak about the topic. These passages are the basic ideas we need to understand our topic. So we go looking for them and then gather them all up into our truck.

[DIAGRAM: Four boxes showing Bible verses: "1 Corinthians 15:20 Jesus rose as the firstfruits", "Acts 2:32-36 Jesus rose as the king", "Romans 1:4 Jesus was raised by the Spirit", "Galatians 1:1 Jesus was raised by the Father", "John 20:1-30 Jesus rose from the dead"]

### 2. Synthesis (Building the house)

The Bible doesn't just give us the bricks and say, "Go build a house." It also gives us the plans for how to build the right house with the bricks we've been given. In other words, the Bible tells us how to put the data from our verses together so that we get an accurate understanding of the topic. Some verses are foundational, others are related but less important.

### 3. Integration (Location, location, location!)

When we build our house, we also need to think about where it should be located in the suburb. Where should our "Resurrection" house stand in relation to the "Cross" house, the "God" house, and the "Humanity" house? Are they connected? In what ways? In what order should we see *them* as we travel down the street? And if the foundations of one house *are* wobbly, in what ways will that affect the other houses?

### 4. Application (Moving in)

Once we've built our house with the right bricks, according to the building plans, in just the right spot for it in the suburb, we don't want to just pat ourselves on the back and wander off—it's time to move in and enjoy! As we settle in to the house and suburb God has given us, we want to live in light of the truths we've discovered. As the Holy Spirit works in us to do that, we become more and more mature. More and more like Jesus.
