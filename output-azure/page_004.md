# // PART 1: THE RESURRECTION GOSPEL //

## OUR SPEAKING ABOUT JESUS

In pairs, one of you take the part of a non-Christian who asks, "So what do Christians believe?" The other partner can take the role of a Christian and try to provide them with a short two minute answer. When you've finished swap roles.

Note down the main ideas or issues you included in your gospel explanation.

## APOSTOLIC SPEAKING ABOUT JESUS

In small groups, skim read two of the following passages and note:
• What part does Jesus' death (and its' significance) play in the apostles' gospel proclamation
• What part does the Jesus' resurrection (and its' significance) play in the apostolic gospel proclamation

| Passage | Significance of Jesus' death | Significance of Jesus' resurrection |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Acts 2:14–41 | | |
| Acts 4:8–12 | | |
| Acts 10:27–43 | | |
| Acts 13:13–41 | | |
| Acts 17:16–34 | | |
| Romans 1:3–4 | | |
| Romans 10:9–13 | | |
| 1 Corinthians 15:1–4 | | |
| 2 Timothy 1:8–12 | | |
| 2 Timothy 2:8 | | |

What differences did you notice between our ways and the apostles' ways of speaking about Jesus?
Why might there be differences?
What questions does this raise about the resurrection and how it fits into the gospel?
