# //APPENDIX 1: RECOMMENDED RESOURCES //

## INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY

- T.C. Hammond, *In understanding Be Men* (IVP)
An older book but a good read. The introduction serves as a good summary of the purpose of systematic theology.

- B. Milne, *Know the Truth* (IVP)
Good on the practical implications of what we believe.

- P.T. Jensen, *At the Heart of the Universe* (Lancer)
Probably the best. Especially good on the framework for systematic theology.

- J.I. Packer, *Knowing God* (Hodder & Stoughton)
An important book on the place of Scripture in doing systematic theology. Encouraging and nourishing.

- A. McGrath, *A Cloud of Witnesses – Ten Great Christian Thinkers* (IVP)
Introduces some key theological ideas by examining their main proponents in history. Nice short chapters. A good read even if you don't like history.

- P.D. Jensen & T. Payne, *The Blueprint* (Matthias Media)
Studies on the AFES doctrinal statement. Includes research and discussion questions.

## GENERAL REFERENCE WORKS

- W.A. Elwell (ed), *Evangelical Dictionary of Theology* (Baker)
Probably the best of the dictionaries.

- D.F. Wright, S.B. Ferguson & J.I. Packer (eds), *New Dictionary of Theology* (IVP)

- D.R.W. Wood, A.R. Millard, J.I. Packer, D.J. Wiseman & I. Howard Marshall (eds), *New Bible Dictionary* (IVP)
Includes articles on many theological ideas

- M. J. Erickson, *Christian Theology* (Baker)
More a text book than a dictionary. For the serious student.

## THEOLOGY OF RESURRECTION

- P. Beasley-Murray, *The Message of the resurrection* (BST)
This book explores all the major NT passages about resurrection. It is simple to read, well structured and helps you think through the implications of the resurrection.

- O'Donovan, *Resurrection and Moral Order* (Eerdmans)
A super-dense but profound treatment of the significance of resurrection to life, especially ethics.

- M. Harris, *Raised immortal; resurrection and immortality in the New Testament* (Eerdmans)
Good on the reality and nature of Jesus' resurrection, less on the theological significance of Jesus' resurrection

- P. Head (Ed), *Proclaiming the Resurrection* (Paternoster Press)

- N.T. Wright, *The Resurrection of the Son of God* (Augsburg)
An epic read (over 800 pages), but great for a serious student who is prepared to think hard.

- R. Shiner, *Raised Forever* (Matthias)
Introduction to how the resurrection changes everything

## APOLOGETICS ON JESUS' RESURRECTION

- L. Strobel, *The Case for the Resurrection: A first-century investigative reporter probes history's pivotal event.*

- J. McDowell, *The Resurrection Factor: Does the historical evidence support the resurrection of Jesus Christ?*

- M. Licona, *The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach*

- P. Lapide, *The Resurrection of Jesus: A Jewish Perspective*
An interesting read. A Jewish man investigates and comes to the conclusion that the resurrection of Jesus happened but remains a Jew. Sort of the Luke 16 scenario.
