# PART 3: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

## 3.1 SIFTING THROUGH THE DATA

Helpful steps:
1. **Search** for the word
2. It may be helpful to **search for other forms** of the word
3. **Brainstorm passages** that you know speaks about the topic
4. **Search related ideas** and the different forms of these words

Now you'll have a lot of data to sort through!

Over the next few pages is a table which are the results from a computer search on the New Testament on resur* or raise* or rise* or lift*.

Now some analysis work has already been done for you in that some are irrelevant to the topic of resurrection (e.g.eyes are raised).

Even then, there is a huge amount of data. Your job now is to sift through the data and

1. **Look out for:**
   - New ideas (to you),
   - Things that don't make sense/don't fit with what you already think;
   - Passages on 'resurrection' (rather than passages that refer to resurrection in passing); and,
   - Old Testament references about resurrection

2. **See whether you can label the passage with a particular topic and gather passages which speak of similar topics together (begin the process of analysis).**
