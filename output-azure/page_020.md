# // PART 4: SYNTHESIS //

At this point there would normally still be a lot of work for you to do in sorting out which passages to focus on and how to fit them together. But in order to speed up the process, we're going to focus on some specific issues that are important for understanding resurrection.

When it comes to developing our systematic theology on resurrection we could start with any of the big ideas we've identified. But because it's probably most familiar to us – and more importantly because the apostles' proclamation of the gospel seems to focus there – we're going to start by exploring some aspects of Jesus' resurrection.

## 4.1 THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS

What do you know about Jesus' resurrection (from the passages you may have looked at in the data collection or from general knowledge)?

- What was the nature of his resurrection body?

- Was it a permanent resurrection?

- Was the resurrected Jesus the same as the "pre-crucified" Jesus

- Is the resurrected Jesus human or divine and does it matter?

- Is the resurrected Jesus doing anything now? If so, what?

If you saw an item on the news reporting that a dead person had come back to life (with very good eye-witness evidence), what would you make of it?
- Would you conclude the person was God?

- Would you conclude that the person was going to be the judge of the world?

- Would you conclude that you would be raised to life after death?

So *why* do you think the resurrection of Jesus has any special significance
