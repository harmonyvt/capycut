## 4.3 JESUS' RESURRECTION: RULING THE WORLD

*Remember Luke 16:31, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead." Understanding the Old Testament and its expectations is necessary for understanding resurrection (see also 1 Peter 1:10-12).*

There are lots of Old Testament passages we could look at that connect to Jesus' resurrection: eg. Genesis 3:15, 5:24, Psalm 16, 110, Daniel 7, Genesis 22, 37-47, Jonah 1:17-2:10 (referred to in Matthew 12:39-40, 2 Kings 18:5; 20:5, 8, Hosea 6:1-2, and lots, lots more. You might like to look them up and think through how they relate to resurrection.

*For the moment we're going to focus on Psalm 8, partly because it's quoted in 1 Corinthians 15:27, and partly because it's so significant for our understanding of resurrection*

### Jesus' resurrection and the place of humanity

**Read Psalm 8.** In the Psalm:

*Under whose feet has God put everything?*


*What passage(s) in the Bible might be the background to this understanding?*


*What position has God given humans in his creation?*


*Why has God done that?*


*Is Psalm 8 a realistic portrayal of human life?*


*Has God withdrawn his intention for humanity?*


Hebrews 2:6-8 also quotes Psalm 8. **Read Hebrews 2:5-15.**

*What does this passage say about how realistic Psalm 8 is in its portrayal of human life?*


*Has God withdrawn his intention for humanity?*


*How is God fulfilling his intention for humanity*


*How good a ruler is Jesus?*


*What result will Jesus' rule have for us?*
