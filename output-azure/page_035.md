# // PART 7: PROCLAIMING RESURRECTION //

## 7.1 SOME IDEAS

### Points of contact

So far, what we have done in doing Systematic Theology is to understand a topic coherently. More than that, in understanding what God says about resurrection we've been given real hope and purpose. We know that Jesus is our risen saviour and judge, messiah and lord of the universe. We know that he has risen victorious over death, and that we are united to him by the Spirit through faith. Where he goes, we go. So we're looking forward to his return and our resurrection to share with him in the new creation. And we know that what we do with our bodies really matters, because our bodies are not disposable shells, but an integral part of us.

It's beautiful! But how do we use what we've learnt to connect with others who don't know Jesus, and to invite them to share with us in all the benefits of his resurrected life

Some points of contact might be:
• Death
• Birth and new life
• Ageing bodies, disease
• Morality
• Purpose

What others can you think of?

Once you've identified these points of contact, how can you use them to talk about Jesus, resurrection, and what it means for life?

*How will you relate it to the story of resurrection?*

*How will you invite them to respond?*

### Options

There are all sorts of ways you could try and persuade others about the truths we've uncovered about resurrection, you could write song or a poem, prepare a Bible study, create a drama.

But to keep it simple we're giving you a choice between writing a short talk (10mins max.) or creating an evangelistic tract focused on resurrection.
